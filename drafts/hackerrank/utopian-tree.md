In this one we will solve question TODO from hackerrank in golang. Let's dive right into it.

# Problem Statement
The question can be found here [Hackerrank TODO problem](TODO). 

The problem states that there is a tree which goes through 2 growth cycles every year. In one of them it doubles its height and in the next on it increrases by 1 meter. The initial length of the tree is 1 meter and we need to return the final length after n growth cycles.

# Solution

We are given many test cases. For each test case, we are given the number of growthg cycles and we need to find the final length after those many growth cycles.

The approach is very simple. For every growth cycle, we will decalre a height variable and assign a value 1 to it i.e. the initail height of the tree. Then we will loop till n times(the number odf growth cycles) and keep on increasing the height according to the question.

Once the loop exits, we will print the final length of the tree.


We have discussed the approach, **I urge you to go ahead on hackerrank and give it another try**. :smile:

<br />
If you are here, it means something went wrong in implementation or you are just too lazy :smile:. In any case, let's see a simple implementation of the above logic.

```go


```

There's nothing complicated with the code itself. Just the code counterpart of the logic discussed above. Notice how we used the for loop like we use while loops in other languages. In GOLnag, for is used like while and do-while. Pretty cool!!! isn't it?

# Summary

So, we solved the TODO problem from hackerrank.

I hope you enjoyed solving this question. This is it for this one, complete source code for this post can be found on my [Github Repo](https://github.com/rishabh1403/hackerrank-golang-solutions). Will see you in the next one.
