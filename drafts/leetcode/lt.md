In this post, we will solve TODO from leetcode and compute it's time and space complexities. Let's begin.
<!--more-->

# Problem Statement
The question can be found at [leetcode TODO problem](TODO).



# Constraints and challenges




# Solution



We have discussed the approach, **I urge you to go ahead on leetcode and give it another try**. :smile:

<hr />
<br />
If you are here, it means something went wrong in implementation or you are just too lazy :smile:. In any case, let's see a simple implementation of the above logic.

```js


};

```

 


Here are the stats on submission

```yaml

Status: Accepted
Runtime: 100ms
Memory: 46MB

```

## Time and space complexity

### Time complexity

We are looping over the string array once, so time complexity
would be **O(n)**.

### Space complexity

We are not using any extra space. So space
complexity is constant, **O(1)**.

# Summary

So, we solved the TODO problem by using two pointer method and calculated the time and space complexities.
