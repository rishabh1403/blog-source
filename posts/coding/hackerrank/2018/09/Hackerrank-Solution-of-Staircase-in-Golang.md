In this post we will solve question staircase from Hackerrank. A simple one, only requires to decode the logic for pattern. Will need if-else and a nested for loop. Let's get started.

# Problem Statement
The question can be found at this [link](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/staircase/problem). The problem statement basically states that we need to print the given pattern for any given number as input.
Couple of things to note here is 

* We need to take a single integer as input.
* Print the given pattern.
* we are solving this in [golang](https://golang.org/).

# Challenges

* Choose our preferred language as [golang](https://golang.org/) on hackerrank. The moment we do that, we get some 50-60 lines of code which are very unfamiliar to someone who is new to language.
* To solve this problem only thing we need to decode the logic for the pattern.
* Formatted printing required.

# Solution

This is the template you get on [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) for this problem statement.

```go
    package main

    import (
        "bufio"
        "fmt"
        "io"
        "os"
        "strconv"
        "strings"
    )

    // Complete the staircase function below.
    func staircase(n int32) {


    }

    func main() {
        reader := bufio.NewReaderSize(os.Stdin, 1024 * 1024)

        nTemp, err := strconv.ParseInt(readLine(reader), 10, 64)
        checkError(err)
        n := int32(nTemp)

        staircase(n)
    }

    func readLine(reader *bufio.Reader) string {
        str, _, err := reader.ReadLine()
        if err == io.EOF {
            return ""
        }

        return strings.TrimRight(string(str), "\r\n")
    }

    func checkError(err error) {
        if err != nil {
            panic(err)
        }
    }

```
* First go ahead and delete everything in the pre-existing template.
* Let's write down our main wrapper function.

```go
package main
import "fmt"

func main(){

}
```
Next we need to take an input, so let's go ahead declare a variable and take an input for our program.

```go

    ...
    var n int
    fmt.Scan(&n)

```

Now let's look at the pattern and try to uunderstand the logic required to print it.

```go

    for an input 4
       #
      ##
     ###
    ####
    
```

Now let's start noting down the points that would help us in printing this pattern

* The pattern has 4 rows, i.e. equal to input number. So we would need a loop which loops over input times
* It has four columns in every row. We would need inner nested loop, which would also loop over input times
* There are two types of output, either an ***space*** or an ***#***. So we need two inner loops instead of one.
* In the first line spaces are 3, # is 1, in second line spaces are 2 and # are 2. If we notice the index of outer loop for the first and second case it is 0,1. So we need to print ***#*** `i+i` times. For the spaces, we need to print it `input-index-1` times. 

Now that we have figured out the logic of the pattern, let's see how the code goes.

```go

    ...
    for i:=0;i<n;i++{
        for j:=0;j<n-i-1;j++{
            fmt.Print(" ")
        }
        for j:=0;j<=i;j++{
            fmt.Print("#")
        }
        fmt.Println()
    }

```

So we have a outer loop which runs `n` times. This to make sure our pattern has `n` rows. Next we have two inner loops, one to print spaces, other for the hash. The first one is running `n-i-i` times and second one `i+1` times. Notice the use of `Print` instead of `Println` , because we need everything to print in one line. Next after the inner loops we print a new line, to move the cursor to next line. This completes our program, and your complete code should look like 

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main(){
    var n int
    fmt.Scan(&n)
    
    for i:=0;i<n;i++{
        for j:=0;j<n-i-1;j++{
            fmt.Print(" ")
        }
        for j:=0;j<=i;j++{
            fmt.Print("#")
        }
        fmt.Println()
    }
}
```
