In this one we will solve question divisible sum pairs from hackerrank in golang. Let's get right into it.

# Problem Statement
The question can be found at this [link](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/divisible-sum-pairs/problem). The problem statement states that we need to find all those pairs of numbers where sum of those numbers are divisible by a given number `k`. 

# Challenges

* Choose our preferred language as [golang](https://golang.org/) on hackerrank. The moment we do that, we get some 50-60 lines of code which are very unfamiliar to someone who is new to language.
* Cracking the logic required to solve the question.

# Solution

This is the template you get on [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) for this problem statement.

```go
    package main

    import (
        "bufio"
        "fmt"
        "io"
        "os"
        "strconv"
        "strings"
    )

    // Complete the divisibleSumPairs function below.
    func divisibleSumPairs(n int32, k int32, ar []int32) int32 {


    }

    func main() {
        reader := bufio.NewReaderSize(os.Stdin, 1024 * 1024)

        stdout, err := os.Create(os.Getenv("OUTPUT_PATH"))
        checkError(err)

        defer stdout.Close()

        writer := bufio.NewWriterSize(stdout, 1024 * 1024)

        nk := strings.Split(readLine(reader), " ")

        nTemp, err := strconv.ParseInt(nk[0], 10, 64)
        checkError(err)
        n := int32(nTemp)

        kTemp, err := strconv.ParseInt(nk[1], 10, 64)
        checkError(err)
        k := int32(kTemp)

        arTemp := strings.Split(readLine(reader), " ")

        var ar []int32

        for i := 0; i < int(n); i++ {
            arItemTemp, err := strconv.ParseInt(arTemp[i], 10, 64)
            checkError(err)
            arItem := int32(arItemTemp)
            ar = append(ar, arItem)
        }

        result := divisibleSumPairs(n, k, ar)

        fmt.Fprintf(writer, "%d\n", result)

        writer.Flush()
    }

    func readLine(reader *bufio.Reader) string {
        str, _, err := reader.ReadLine()
        if err == io.EOF {
            return ""
        }

        return strings.TrimRight(string(str), "\r\n")
    }

    func checkError(err error) {
        if err != nil {
            panic(err)
        }
    }


```
* First go ahead and delete everything in the pre-existing template.
* Let's write down our main wrapper function.

```go
package main
import "fmt"

func main(){

}
```
Let's discuss the variables that we would need for our question. We need the length of array `n`, the number `k`, the counter the store the result `c`,  and the array itself. Since we need to find pairs of numbers, instead of taking inputs in temporary variables we would need it in a array so that we can loop over it and form a pair. Let's declare our variables, our array, takes inputs and come back again to discuss the logic.

```go

	...
    var n,k,c int
    fmt.Scan(&n,&k)
    
    a := make([]int,n)
    
    for i:=0;i<n;i++ {
        fmt.Scan(&a[i])
    }
   
```

Nothing fancy here, declaring the variables as discussed, declaring the array and taking it's elements as inputs. Let's discuss the logic now. So we need to form pairs in a way where the `a[i]+a[j] % k = 0 and i<j ` , so it's pretty simple we will have an outer loop which will loop over the array from `0` to length of array while the inner loop will loop over the array from `i+1` i.e. the condition that `j>i` to length of array. Now we can form pairs of numbers from `(i,j) index` and check for divisibility by `k`. If it is divisible, we will increase the counter, else we will move one in the next loop. If that sounds clear, let's implement it now.

```go

	...
    for i:=0;i<n;i++{
        for j:=i+1;j<n;j++{
            if (a[i]+a[j]) % k == 0 {
                c++
            }
        }
    }
    fmt.Println(c)

```

Just implementing the logic we discussed and printing our counter. Now your complete code should look like

```go

package main

import "fmt"

func main(){
    var n,k,c int
    fmt.Scan(&n,&k)
    
    a := make([]int,n)
    
    for i:=0;i<n;i++ {
        fmt.Scan(&a[i])
    }
    
    for i:=0;i<n;i++{
        for j:=i+1;j<n;j++{
            if (a[i]+a[j]) % k == 0 {
                c++
            }
        }
    }
    fmt.Println(c)
}

```
