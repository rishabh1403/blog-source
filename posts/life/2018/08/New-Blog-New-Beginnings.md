My first blog. Just getting the hang of it and posting some random thoughts.
<!--more-->
# Quick Background
My first blog. Just getting the hang of it and posting some random thoughts.
Well technically speaking it's not my first blog. I have tried starting a blog many times before, say around 5 times or so; and boy I have failed, miserably. Every single time I used to sit down, try to search for a platform for days, finalize on a theme for another couple of days and by the time I had everything setup and a couple of blogs posted, I found myself out of energy and will to write anymore. Maybe I was running after the idea of writing a blog to earn a lot of money. I guess it was too naive of me to assume that money would just start pouring from day one. Maybe I was running after recognition, I guess it was too naive of me to assume that I would start generating huge traffic from first hour. Enough whining, I started blogs in past with different goals. Didn't work out, no issues. New goal.
# What's the plan
Unlike last time, and before that, and so on I do have a stable day job, no monetization needed from blog. Recognition, umm.. not sure if I really want that anymore. Don't get me wrong, I do like making new friends and connections, but that is not the sole motivation anymore. So why start a blog? Well I am software developer by day and freelancer during night, so I hardly get to write at all!!! Recently I also started reading books, (yeah wasn't doing that till now) and I like it. So I thought why not start writing again, whatever I can, whenever I can. I have read that writing improves your ( pardon my lack of word ) *writing* skills. So that's my motivation here, to improve my skills, sounds fair ?
# What would I post
Umm... General random thoughts, I do some coding at work, so will post some tutorials and articles on various tech topics. At this point I am not really sure what would be the scope of articles, but general random stuff + tech is what I have in mind as of now.
## Are you done?
Won't bore you anymore. This time I am not going to fail. Sincere motivation :), at least one post per week is what I am targeting for.

See you around :)
