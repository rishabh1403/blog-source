So I got a new bike, I was over the moon, but I was new to biking. I wanted to
take it to all parts of the country, but knew nothing about safety gear or
fixing small issues with the bike. I knew what I had to do...*join a biking
group*.

# Search for a biking group

On a long ride, it's so important to ride in groups(smaller groups though). You
always have someone to back you up in case things go south. You learn new things
almost every time you ride with them. Every day, the only time I was riding the
bike, was to and from the office. It wasn't much and unfortunately full of
traffic:disappointed:. I never got to test its high speed!!!. I'm glad I didn't, I wasn't
ready. Hence my search began for a biking group:books:. I asked around, left some texts
to people around my neighborhood, but no luck finding a group.

It's very important to join a small group of responsible riders. Too large a
group and nobody cares about you, most of them don't even know you. Too small a
group and you miss out on all the pros. If the people in the group are not
experienced and responsible, you pick up bad riding style and make that a habit
pretty soon. We all know how that ends!!!:bangbang:. It was my first bike and 4 more were
on the way:stuck_out_tongue:. I wanted to ride long and all over the country, who knows, even
outside the country. Finally, one fine day, I woke up to a nice little surprise.

# New biking group

There was a message on one of our society's group about someone enquiring if
anyone else rides a bike and would love to join for a group ride. Hallelujah,
before sunset there was another biking group with 4 members in it. I was happy,
excited and was looking forward to next weekend for our first group ride. Alas,
everyone bailed out but two of us, but we went anyways. For the first time I
touched ***120kmph*** and it felt exciting as well as terrifying. 

Following, our first group ride, there were many plans we made and all of them
got canceled. Good thing it did. One of the guys in our group was already a part
of a 7 member bike group. One fine day, being not so happy about all our
canceled plans he asked if we would like to ride with their group. Two of us said yes and the very next weekend, we were riding in Kartik's
group. Finally, *I was a part of a biking group*.

# Something to look forward to...

I learned a lot about safe riding and group riding from him and other members of
the group. We did many smaller rides followed by some long rides. I'll tell
you guys all about it later. For now, I'd like to take this moment alone to
thank Kartik and Sankalp for being a mentor and a really good friend. 

That's it for this one guys, stay tuned for the next one, where I'll tell you
guys about some of our short rides and take you guys along me on my biking
journey. 

Stay tuned and I'll see you around
