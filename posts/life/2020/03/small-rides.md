I had joined a biking group. It was time to go for a ride. On our first
breakfast ride, I was so excited I couldn't sleep whole night. The plan was to
leave at 5 am early in the morning. I was sure that we are going to be delayed.
No one is punctual in India, especially about things like leaving on time,
coming on time and so on. Since I couldn't sleep whole day, I was at the first
meeting spot on time. It took me by surprise to see Kartik and Sankalp there on
time too. Wow, people do follow rules here!!!.

We left on time, and me met more people at meeting point 2 and 3 and finally we
were heading towards our destination for breakfast. By the way Kartik left 2 of
them behind who weren't on time. This haunts me till now and help me come on
time on every ride.

The moment we hit the highway, I started to increase my speed only to be stopped
by another rule, "No one shall overtake the lead". I was like, what the heck!!!,
the lead(Kartik) was driving at 80kmph, that was slow, but to stick to the
rules, I stay just on his tails. I thought of a new Idea, I started slowing
down, and thought I'll keep myself the the last and then will drive fast
overtaking everyone till I reach the lead. But, rule alert!!! "No one shall ride
behind the tail". I was lost. I was stuck driving at 80kmph the whole way. If
anyone slowed the whole group slowed, if anyone went fast, well you can't
overtake the lead, so play between the tail and the lead. 

At first, it was frustating for me, but soon I started realizing the logic and
importance of these rules. The whole group sticks together like a team. We were
on a **group ride**, not an individual ride. I realized the importance more,
when I took a wrong turn and got lost. Soon, Kartik found me and I saw the whole
group waiting for me. 

After this ride, we did a lot of smaller rides, and everytime I learned new
thing about the mechanics of a group ride. I started getting more and more
confident on road and in turn started enjoying our slow ride. Individually, you
are fast but vulnerable, in a group you are slow but safe. I always wanted to
ride for my whole life, and Kartik helped me understand that you ride slow,
you ride long. The faster you ride above the speed limit, the sooner my biking
can end. This stuck by me and stopped trying to overtake him everytime. 

Well, although I started following the rules somewhat happily and whole
heartedly, having a sports bike, sometimes I wanted to unleash all that power.
Well, thankfully, sometimes kartik allowed me to overtake him and for the first
time I touch 140kmph(I crossed this one later too) on a road with a speed limit of 80kmph. I was enjoying my
somewhat freedom and laxation of rules responsibly and exploited it only on some
occasions.

We went on many short rides ranging from 70kms to 300km round trip rides for
breakfast or lunch depending on the weather. In all of them, the highlight was
the ride and not the food. We usaully eat the same thing everytime with a cup of
tea/coffee.

After many short rides, it was time for a long ride. Lansdowne, it was. My first
long ride. I'm gonna end this one here and talk about Lansdowne in the next one.

That's it for this one guys, stay tune and I'll see you around.
