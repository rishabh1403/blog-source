Where it all started!!!. I think this is the best I can describe that journey. My first solo trip, 
my first trip in fact. I had never travelled before just for the fun of it. Every place I had visited earlier was either for work or family obligations(sad). This was my first trip for fun, for leisure, for me. My solo one day trip to rishikesh

## The Plan

It was around 4 o'clock one saturday evening(enter date). I was bored the hell out of life after spending about 6 months in Gurgaon. All my college friends were in Bangalore ( that's another story in itself...my move from bangalore to delhi) . I was crying my eyes out and reached out to my friend ( who is also an avid traveller and foodie ). I asked him about the places I can visit for a day and he suggested Rishikesh. He started helping me out with buses and hostels and before I knew it, my bus leaves in 3 hours. I packed couple of stuff and left in shorts and flip flops ( wrong decision ). I had booked a hostel for the day and got some recommended places which he suggested me to visit. Thus, I had a plan for a day long solo trip and the bus was already on it's way to a journey which was going to change my life for good.

## The shock

I got down from bus around 8 o'clock in the morning. Rishikesh was still 11kms from the bus stand. So took a public auto to the center of the city. The drive towards the city was for refreshing
