Where it all started!!!. I think this is the best I can describe that journey. My first solo trip, 
my first trip in fact. I had never travelled before just for the fun of it. Every place I had visited earlier was either for work or family obligations(sad). This was my first trip for fun, for leisure, for me. My solo one day trip to rishikesh

## The Plan

It was around 4 o'clock one saturday evening(enter date). I was bored the hell out of life after spending about 6 months in Gurgaon. All my college friends were in Bangalore ( that's another story in itself...my move from bangalore to delhi) .
