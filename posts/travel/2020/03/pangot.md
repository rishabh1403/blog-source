description: "Where it all started!!!. I think this is the best I can describe that journey. My first solo trip, 
my first trip in fact. I had never traveled before just for the fun of it. Every place I had visited earlier was either for work or family obligations. This was my first trip for fun, for leisure, for me. My solo one day trip to Rishikesh"

November was a really rough for we were working really hard to good amount of
work done in our company. After that came the cool down period, and one fine
day, out of the blue, everyone decided to take a company trip for 2 days. Before
we could let it sink, Shubham was ready with the itenary and cost estimation.
The very same weekend we left for Pangot, again in the mountains where you don't
even get cellular networks(that was the best part).

We left around 10PM for an overnight journey. Weather forecast predicted heavy
snow and it had just snowed the day before we left. Thanks to Abhik, I got good
boots and jackets for snow before I left, else I would have got frost bite for
sure. The fog was too dense, and it was hard to see anything ahead of us. Not
sure why we were going to the mountains in winters, but I was excited for it. It
was our first company trip. 

Around 3AM almost everyone was asleep in the bus except me(yeah drive slept
too). I was looking at the spedometer and suddenly I would see speeds dropping
from 80kmph to 20mkmph and the vehicle getting a bit disbalanced. What I saw
next, blew my mind away. The driver of the bus was dozing off at regular
intervals and when I confronted him, he denied the allegations. I started
keeping an eye on him. He knew I was onto him and tried to stay awake for a long
time, but eventually started dozing off again. 

For me, that was it. I woke Abhik and Shubham up, and we pulled over the bus. We
took a 30 minute tea break and went on with our journey. He didn't sleep after
that(thankfully). 

Due to heavy snow the day before, the roads to Pangot was closed and we had to
take a detour. THe detour was scary. Roads were tracherous, narrow and broken.
MOst of it was covered in sludge and driving through them would becaome too
dangerous and troublesome very often. We had started losing our cellular signals
and it was getting difficult to navigate. Luckily for us, it was a single path,
no turns no confusions.

We stopped around 3 kms before our camp because of heavy snow on road. An open
jeep from our camp had come to recieve us. We put all our stuff in the back,
boarded it were on our way to the camp. The best part of the trip was our ride
in the jeep. It was fun and chilly. We were driving on the snow covered
mountains and it felt so relaxing. It was my first experience on snow and it
exceeded my expectations by miles. We were hooting, shouting and singing all the
way to the camp. The ride along with the sceneries along the way were breath
taking.

The camp was beautiful with nice cute little cottages. Each cottage had two
double beds/ One of them was little elevated had was accesible via a ladder. A
bunk bed!!!. I love bunk beds. I wanted to sleep on one. 

It was morning already and we headed to have our breakfast. THe food there was
surprisingly good, and best of all, therer was no cellular connection. The camp
had a wifi facility(only in dining hall) which was more than enogh tyo keep our
families informed. I always loved the water quality in the mountains, it makes
me feel good and it works wonders for my tummy. After breakfast, we dispersed
and someof us headed to sleep, some of us went for a bath and explore the
mountains while most of us started playing a game of cricket. We played for a
whole 4 hours till late afternoon and went for lunch only after we were forced
to. Food again was really good and was followed by a long comapny meeting. We
brainstormed for quite sometime until the bonfire.

Bonfire wwas fun, people were frinking and eating and singing. I was mostly
curled up in a blanked and sat as close the fire I could. Some of us sang really
good. It was an evening well spent and we retired to our cottages after dinner.
I got to sleep on a bunk bed.

I got up early next morning and found out couple of othere were too. Wew ent for
a walk and came across a really cute dog near by. It was fun to play with him.
He was tripping over snow and the sight melted my heart. I always wanted a dog,
and this sight made sure, i'm getting one sooner than later. I played in snow
for sometime and was tahnkful to Abhik and shubham because those shoes were a
life saver. The rest of the day went jusdt like the last one, games and good
food. The cold weather was taking a toll on some people and we started worrying
for their health. Luckily it wasn't anything very serious and everything worked
out fine eventually. In the evening we had another gathering where we socialized a bit before
retiring to sleep. I got the bunk bed again.

We left for delhi next mnorning. We got to aboard the snow train again and it
was fun again. I'll admit the drive in snow was rthe best part of the trip.
Following that, we boarded out bus and left for Delhi. We all reached our homes,
safe and sound and that concluded our 3 day fun filled trip to Pangot.

That is it for thuis one guys, stay tuned and i'll see you around in the next
one where my biking group went to Jim Corbett national park for a 2 day bike ride.
